# Hangman
    #### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/clc0BwuYCBk>
    #### Description:
    This classic hangman game is a command line game that has the user guess letters in a randomized word. The user has 6 tries to guess the whole word before the hangman is fully drawn. For every wrong guess, a new body part is added to the hangman board, just like the original hangman game we all grew up with. If the user ends up guessing the word correctly, a congratulatory message is displayed. If not the user will see a try again message and be shown what the word was.

    Initially I was going to use a class for the stopwatch timer but after running into complications with implementing that idea, I decided to just separate the start and end timer functions to keep it simple. I could have taken the easier route from the start instead of trying to use OOP, but I wanted to challenge myself and not take shortcuts. Maybe in the future I'll revisit trying an OOP approach.

    The files in this project folder contains all the material and information for my final project. The requirements.txt lists all the modules/libraries used, including re, time, and random_words. These add an extra element of fun to the game. The README.md displays the project title, video link, and description of what the project does. project.py contains the actual code, and test_project.py has unit tests that validate three functions to ensure the program is bug free.

    This CS50 journey has been amazing and I could not be more grateful to you, Professor Malan. As of now my journey still continues and hope to reach somewhere succesful in the future thanks to you.

    This was CS50!
